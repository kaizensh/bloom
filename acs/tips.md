Solve it on pen and paper first

Ask yourself how would a human do it?

Break it down step by step as detailed as you can/need

Think like a villain (what edge cases might exist?)

Write psuedo code if needed.

Try and solve the problem first, then refactor.

Try solving via a "test driven development" workflow
